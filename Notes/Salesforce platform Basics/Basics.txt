#Get to Know Our Terms

App                         :  in Salesforce is a set of objects, fields,
                               and other functionality that supports a business process.

Objects                     :  are tables in the Salesforce database that store a particular kind of information.
                               There are standard objects like Accounts and Contacts and 
                               custom objects like the Property object you see in the graphic.

Standard objects            :  are objects that are included with Salesforce. Common business objects like Account, Contact, Lead, and Opportunity are all standard objects.

Custom objects

Records                     :  are rows in object database tables. Records are the actual data associated with an object.

Fields                      :  are columns in object database tables. Both standard and custom objects have fields. 

Package                     :  It's has 18-characters 
                               ex: 04tB0000000OE9wIAG

Declarative                 :  Developing without code is known as declarative development.
                               With declarative development, you use forms and drag-and-drop tools to perform powerful customization tasks.

Programmatic                :  The platform also offers programmatic development, which uses things like Lightning components. 

Chatter feed                :  Every time you create a custom object, you automatically get something called Chatter feed tracking.
                               Chatter feed tracking provides a way for multiple people to comment and collaborate on a particular record.
                               The discussions and decisions are stored on the record so everyone can stay up to date on important decisions.
       
                               By creating a single custom object, you can totally change how your organization collaborates. High impact, low effort. As you start building with the platform, keep your eye out for processes with:
 
                                 1. Heavy email collaboration
                                 2. Reliance on spreadsheets
                                 3. Shared local documents
                                 4. Time-intensive, repetitive manual steps
                                 5. Impact on only a few departments (you want to minimize the number of stakeholders while you’re still learning)
                                 6. Processes with these traits are great candidates for early projects on the Salesforce platform.            

Salesforce Architecture     :  Salesforce is a cloud company. Everything we offer resides in the trusted, multitenant cloud.
                               The Salesforce platform is the foundation of our services. 
                               It’s powered by metadata and made up of different parts, like data services, artificial intelligence, and robust APIs for development.
                               All our apps sit on top of the platform. Our prebuilt offerings like Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud, along with apps you build using the platform, have consistent, powerful functionality. 


 Multitenancy               :  Multitenancy is a great word for making you sound smart at dinner parties, but really all it means is that you’re sharing resources.
                               Salesforce provides a core set of services to all our customers in the multitenant cloud.
                               No matter the size of your business, you get access to the same computing power, data storage, and core features.
                               you’re getting the latest and greatest features with automatic, seamless upgrades three times a year.
                               Since Salesforce is a cloud service, you never have to install new features or worry about your hardware. All this is possible because of multitenancy.

 Metadata                   :  metadata is data about data.

                               Now, imagine you stripped away all that specific data. What are you left with?
                               You are left with the Property object along with all its fields, like address, price, and number of bedrooms.
                               You can also have page layouts, security settings, and any other customizations you’ve made. 

                               All of these standard and custom configurations, functionality, and code in your org are metadata.
                               Part of the reason you can move so fast on the platform is that Salesforce knows how to store and serve you that metadata immediately after you create it.

API                         :  APIs allow different pieces of software to connect to each other and exchange information.

                               APIs are similar. Without knowing the details, you can connect your apps with other apps or software systems.\
                               The underlying technology takes care of the specifics of how information passes throughout the system.

                               Earlier, we talked about the database. When you add a custom object or field, the platform automatically creates an API name that serves as an access point between your org and the database.
                               Salesforce uses that API name to retrieve the metadata and data you’re looking for.

Administration              :  The Administration category is where you manage your users and data. You can do things like add users, change permissions, import and export data, and create email templates.

Platform Tools              :  You do most of your customization in Platform Tools. You can view and manage your data model, create apps, modify the user interface, and deploy new features to your users.
                               If you decide to try your hand at programmatic development, Platform Tools is where you manage your code as well.   

Settings                    :  Finally, Settings is where you manage your company information and org security.
                               You can do things like add business hours, change your locale, and view your org’s history.

App Exchange                :  You’re probably comfortable with the idea of app stores.\
                               Whether you’re downloading apps on your phone, tablet, computer, or other device, you have to download and install apps to make the most of your technology.

Where’d My App Go?          :  Apps are installed using something called a package.
