#Get to Know Our Terms

App     :  in Salesforce is a set of objects, fields,
           and other functionality that supports a business process.

Objects :  are tables in the Salesforce database that store a particular kind of information.
           There are standard objects like Accounts and Contacts and 
           custom objects like the Property object you see in the graphic.

Records :  are rows in object database tables. Records are the actual data associated with an object.

Fields  :  are columns in object database tables. Both standard and custom objects have fields. 

Package : It's has 18-characters 
          ex: 04tB0000000OE9wIAG

Declarative : Developing without code is known as declarative development.
              With declarative development, you use forms and drag-and-drop tools to perform powerful customization tasks.

Programmatic: The platform also offers programmatic development, which uses things like Lightning components. 

Chatter feed : Every time you create a custom object, you automatically get something called Chatter feed tracking.
               Chatter feed tracking provides a way for multiple people to comment and collaborate on a particular record.
               The discussions and decisions are stored on the record so everyone can stay up to date on important decisions.

                By creating a single custom object, you can totally change how your organization collaborates. High impact, low effort. As you start building with the platform, keep your eye out for processes with:

                1. Heavy email collaboration
                2. Reliance on spreadsheets
                3. Shared local documents
                4. Time-intensive, repetitive manual steps
                5. Impact on only a few departments (you want to minimize the number of stakeholders while youâ€™re still learning)
                6. Processes with these traits are great candidates for early projects on the Salesforce platform.
