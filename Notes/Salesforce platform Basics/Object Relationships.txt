Object Relationships    :   Object relationships are a special field type that connects two objects together.

                         --> Exampale :     Let’s think about a standard object like Account.
                                            If a sales rep opens an account, they’ve probably been talking to a few people at that account’s company. 
                                            They’ve probably made contacts like executives or IT managers and stored those contacts’ information in Salesforce.

                                            It makes sense, then, that there should be a relationship between the Account object and the Contact object. And there is!

                                            When you look at an account record in Salesforce, you can see that there’s a section for contacts on the Related tab. 
                                            You can also see that there’s a button that lets you quickly add a contact to an account.
